    	<strong>Services</strong>
  	</p>
  	<p>
    	(a) We offer a technology platform to provide information and a means for you to obtain transport and logistics services from Participating Providers through the use of GoGoVan. GoGoVan allows you to send a request for transport and logistics services (together with details of you and your journey) to Participating Providers and each relevant Participating Provider has the sole discretion to accept or reject each such request. If a Participating Provider accepts a request, GoGoVan will notify you and provide information about the Participating Provider such as the vehicle licence number, contact number and driver rating (if any).
  	</p>
  	<p>
    	(b) You acknowledge and agree that we only act as an intermediary between you and the Participating Providers and we are not your agent or the agent of the Participating Providers. We are not a transportation carrier and do not provide transportation services. We are not responsible for the behaviour, negligence, conduct, actions or inactions on the part of the Participating Providers that you may use (through GoGoVan or otherwise). Any contract for the provision of transport and logistics services is between you and the Participating Providers and not us. We shall never be a party to any agreement (to be) entered into between you and any Participating Providers. If you have any complaint in relation to the transport and logistics service provided then that dispute must be taken up with the Participating Provider directly.
  	</p>
  	<p>
    	(c) You must keep secure and confidential and not disclose to any third party any username or password that we may provide to you in relation to access to GoGoVan and the Services.
  	</p>
