    	<p><li>Customer shall ensure that the Shipment is properly packaged so as to protect against damage to the Shipment during the course of delivery, and:</li></p>

  	<ol type="i">

    	<p><li>in the case of a Shipment of a fragile nature, that Shipment shall be packaged in a case or container of sufficient durability and strength and shall be encased in or surrounded by sufficient and suitable protective material inside that case or container such that the Shipment is guarded against damage that may result from any force, pressure or blows to which delivery items are ordinarily subject during the course of delivery and that such Shipment shall bear the words &ldquo;FRAGILE&rdquo; prominently displayed in capital letters on the face of the case or container and above the address of the named addressee; and</li></p>

  	<h4>2. Unacceptable Shipments</h4>

  	<ol type="a">
    	<p><li>GoGoVan may refuse to render its services in the transportation of any unacceptable Shipment and, if carriage is in progress, GoGoVan may suspend carriage and hold the Shipment.&nbsp; Customer guarantees that its Shipment is acceptable for transportation.&nbsp; A Shipment is deemed unacceptable for transportation if:</li></p>

  	<ol type="i">

    	<p><li>it is classified as hazardous material, dangerous goods, prohibited or restricted articles by any applicable government department or other relevant organisation or under any applicable laws of any relevant jurisdiction;</li></p>
    	<p><li>it contains counterfeit goods, animals, bullion, currency, bearer form negotiable instruments, precious metals and stones; real or imitation firearms, parts thereof, weapons, explosives and ammunition; human or animal remains, pornography or illegal narcotics/drugs or substances,&nbsp;</li></p>
    	<p><li>it contains any other item which GoGoVan decides cannot be carried safely or legally, or</li></p>

    	<p><li>Customer requests any change to the scope of GoGoVan&rsquo;s services to which GoGoVan does not agree in writing; or</li></p>
    	<p><li>it (or parts or contents thereof) is of a value exceeding SGD[250].</li></p>


  	</ol>
    	<p><li>GoGoVan shall not be liable for loss of, damage to or delay in delivery of any item that is included in any Shipment that is unacceptable for transportation, whether or not Customer has informed GoGoVan of any such items.&nbsp; If GoGoVan suspends or decline to provide its service in respect of any Shipment which is deemed unacceptable for transportation, then Customer shall not be entitled to any refund of transportation fee paid by Customer to GoGoVan in respect of such Shipment.&nbsp;</li></p>
    	<p><li>GoGoVan also reserves the right to refuse to provide service, among other reasons, for any Shipment which by reason of the dangerous or other character of its contents may, in the sole judgment of GoGoVan, soil, taint or otherwise damage other packages or GoGoVan&rsquo;s equipment, or which is improperly or insecurely packed or wrapped. In addition, GoGoVan reserves the right either to refuse to provide service for any Shipment or to or from any location, or to provide alternative service arrangements, when, among other reasons, GoGoVan, in its sole discretion, deems that it is unsafe or economically or operationally impracticable to provide service.</li></p>
    	<p><li>GoGoVan may at its option suspend transportation of any Shipment if goods are found not to be acceptable for transportation for any of the above reason whatsoever, if GoGoVan cannot effect delivery at the second attempt to do so, if the addressee refuses to accept delivery, or if it cannot collect amounts due from the receiver on delivery.&nbsp; Customer will be responsible for payment of all charges, calculated in accordance with the then current GoGoVan rates, caused by such suspension of transportation, including, but not limited to, forwarding, disposal, or return of transportation charges as well as any duty or tax, if applicable.</li></p>

  	<p style="margin-left:40px">Shipments cannot be delivered to PO boxes or postal codes.&nbsp; Shipments are delivered to the receiver&rsquo;s address given by Customer but not necessarily to the named receiver personally.&nbsp; Shipments to addresses with a central receiving area will be delivered to that area.&nbsp; If the Shipment is deemed to be unacceptable, or the receiver cannot be reasonably identified or located, or the receiver refuses delivery or to pay for delivery, or GoGoVan is unable to deliver the Shipment for any reason whatsoever, GoGoVan shall use reasonable efforts to return the Shipment to Customer at Customer&rsquo;s cost, failing which the Shipment may be released, disposed of or sold by GoGoVan without incurring any liability whatsoever to Customer or anyone else, with the proceeds applied against service charges and related administrative costs and the balance of the proceeds of a sale (if any) to be returned to Customer.</p>

  	<p style="margin-left:40px">Shipment charges are as determined by GoGoVan upon your application for use of its services and written confirmation of acceptance by GoGoVan to provide its services.&nbsp; Customer shall also pay any additional charges or rates for non-standard service, additional or non-standard usage and any other additional charges referenced in the effective GoGoVan additional charge guide, or those applicable additional rates set out in any customised contracts.&nbsp; Customer shall pay or reimburse GoGoVan for all Shipment charges, ancillary charges, storage charges, duties and taxes owed for services provided by GoGoVan or incurred by GoGoVan on Customer&rsquo;s or Shipment receiver&rsquo;s or any third party&rsquo;s behalf and all claims, damages, fines and expenses incurred if the Shipment is deemed unacceptable for transport as described in Section 2. &nbsp;</p>

  	<h4>6. GoGoVan&rsquo;s Liability</h4>

  	<ol type="a">
    	<p><li>Customer agrees that GoGoVan&rsquo;s liability in respect of the Shipment is strictly limited to direct loss only.&nbsp; All other types of loss or damage are excluded (including but not limited to loss of profits, income, interest, future business, or loss of revenue resulting from loss of use), whether such loss or damage is special or indirect, and even if the risk of such loss or damage was brought to GoGoVan&rsquo;s attention before or after acceptance of the Shipment.&nbsp; Customer shall insure at its own costs against any risks in respect of the Shipment. &nbsp;</li></p>
    	<p><li>Without prejudice to Sections 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9 below, GoGoVan&rsquo;s total liability in respect of any Shipment shall be limited to its actual cash value but in any event shall not exceed SGD[250] (whichever is the lower).&nbsp; Customer shall not raise more than one claim for each Shipment and settlement of such claim shall be full and final settlement for all loss or damage in connection with such Shipment.&nbsp; If Customer considers these limits as insufficient to protect itself or the Shipment, then it must make its own insurance arrangements, failing which Customer shall assume all risks of loss or damage in respect of the Shipment. GoGoVan shall not be under any liability to offer Customer&rsquo;s cargo insurance or to buy any insurance in respect of the Shipment.&nbsp; Customer who needs cargo insurance or all risk insurance should purchase those insurances from third parties.&nbsp;</li></p>

  	<ol type="a">
    	<p><li>All claims against GoGoVan must be submitted in writing to GoGoVan as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within [7] days from the date that GoGoVan accepted the Shipment, failing which GoGoVan shall have no liability whatsoever.&nbsp;</li></p>
    	<p><li>All claims must be made in writing, accompanied by the original waybill, consignment note, relevant invoices and receipts and other supporting documents as may be requested by GoGoVan and submitted to the following address:</li></p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer agrees and acknowledges that all deliveries are subject to potential delays including but not limited to delays resulting from adverse traffic conditions.&nbsp; In the event that GoGoVan is unable to deliver the Shipment by the indicated preferred delivery date and/or time, GoGoVan shall make every reasonable effort to deliver the Shipment on the day after the indicated preferred delivery date.&nbsp;</li></p>
    	<p><li>Customer may instruct GoGoVan to discontinue delivery of a Shipment, send the Shipment back to Customer, forward the Shipment to another addressee or to dispose of the Shipment, provided that the Shipment is still in GoGoVan&rsquo;s possession and has not been delivered to the addressee.&nbsp; All costs arising from the aforesaid instructions shall be borne by Customer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GoGoVan reserves the right to decline to accept such instructions for any reason whatsoever.&nbsp; Customer will be notified in the event that GoGoVan declines to accept such instructions.</li></p>
